# ML-with-PIMA-Indians-Diabetes-Dataset
The dataset used in this project is included as diabetes.csv. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable.

## Dataset
The diabetes dataset consists of eight features:
* Pregnancies- Number of times pregnant
* Glucose- Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
* BloodPressure- Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* SkinThickness- Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
* Insulin- 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
* BMI- Body mass index (weight in kg / (height in m)^2)
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction- Diabetes pedigree function
* Age- Age (years)

The outcome is of two types:
* 0 for non-diabetic
* 1 for diabetic patients

## Objective
The objective of this project was to predict the outcome using the above mentioned features and finding the importance of different features in determining the outcome.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to gain introductory exposure to Machine Learning Classification concepts along with data visualization. The project makes use of Scikit-Learn, Pandas and Data Visualization(Matplotlib and Seaborn) Libraries.
